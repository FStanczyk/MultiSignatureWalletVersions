# MultiSignatureWalletVersions
Layout made with tutorial made by @SmartContractProgrammer.


This project was about learning. I would not recommend to use it in the mainnet since it was not audited professionally. 

First contract is the basic multi-signature wallet I have learned from @SmartContractProgrammer. 
Second contract is my extension which introduces some features like Admin, who can deny any transaction no matter 
how many approves it has (of course as long as it's not already executed). Other feature is changing the number 
of required approvals or adding/removing members.

I have a feeling that multi-signature wallet in pair with prescpription manager would make a good and really 
useful combination.
